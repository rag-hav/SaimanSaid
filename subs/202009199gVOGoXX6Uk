00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.400
Tonight on Saiman Shows—

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.200
the second best reaction channel
on YouTube India,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000
Slayy Point!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.120
I love you all!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.880
Friends! Despite no content,
no destination,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.160
I still have uploaded a video.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.280
It seems roasting someone
is my content, my destination.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.500
Hit it!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
Back in 2016,
when roses were red,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
Saiman started vlogging,
and nobody cared.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.040
Saiman said,
but nobody heard.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.120
Nobody gave a shit
about this nerd.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.180
Welcome!

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.920
Everybody, welcome!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160
(Hello, everybody. Welcome to Saiman Says.)

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.760
The chai had less sugar.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.780
Understand the sarcasm.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.940
Then one day Saiman
roasted Amit Bhadana,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.640
He got hate comments saying,
"Get your ass fucked 🖕"

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.320
But he wasn't looking
for any sympathy,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.460
because he had his intern, Timothy!

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.680
Welcome!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.360
Everybody, welcome!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660
(Hello, everybody. Welcome to Saiman Says.)

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.760
Together we'll do some hard work.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.560
Understand the sarcasm.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.220
The channel's growth
was very slow,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.280
and Saiman was feeling
very low.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
To cheer him up,
Timothy sent some nudes.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.320
But then next day, he got
a shoutout from Pewds!

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.380
Welcome!

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.060
Everybody, welcome!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.840
(Hello, everybody. Welcome to Saiman Says.)

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.680
Saiman had an orgasm.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.720
Understand the sarcasm.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.220
Now Saiman was speaking
more than Kabira,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.020
this snake didn't have a charmer.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.000
(hiss)
this snake didn't have a charmer.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.040
He roasted TikTok,
before it was cool.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.640
And now it's a YouTube channel,
watched by all the school.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.960
Welcome!

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.520
Everybody, welcome!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.620
(Hello, everybody. Welcome to Saiman Says.)

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.820
Cum, cum, cum,
they need some cum!

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.600
Understand the sarcasm.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.860
(Indian Jim)

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.420
Aigo!

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.180
Hello, everybody.
Welcome...

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.020
to Saiman Shows!

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.260
You know, everybody asks what Saiman says,
but nobody asks what Saiman feels.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.220
So today on
Saiman Shows,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.180
Saiman is going to show
what Saiman feels,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.120
and Saiman feels very sad

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.360
for Indian gamers because
PUBG got banned, right?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.220
More than half of Indian gamers
are now jobless. Am I right?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760
I hope they get depressed,
and lose all motivation in life.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.580
Anyway, I saw the FAU-G poster,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.660
I mean, come on.
Picking a ShutterStock image,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.460
applying an Instagram filter,
we have a new,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.620
"all new" video game poster.
Very nice.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.260
Even Tanmay Bhat's
content isn't this low effort.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.980
(Ba Dum Tss)

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.040
See, I don't have a problem with
copying, okay? I mean, come on.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.020
But if you're copying something,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.520
then at least put some effort
to make it look different. Right?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.360
Akshay Kumar sir, we want you to
be in a 'Hera Pheri' sequel, okay?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.180
But don't do such method acting
where you become the character,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.800
and apply the same in real life.
Please don't do this.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800
And what all has happened in
the past couple months?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.400
It's been almost 2 months.
Right, Aditya?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.200
It's been 2 months since
I've uploaded a video, guys.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.500
A lot has happened since then.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.640
Like, like...many corona cases
have happened since then.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.600
(Ba Dum Tss)

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.360
And yeah, Hindustani Bhau's account is
gone from both YouTube and Instagram.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600
Social media did a "piss off, d*ckhead" on Bhau.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.000
It's got somewhat outdated.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.220
Talking about d*cks,
there's an airline called Lauda.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.040
This adds a whole new meaning to

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.300
"hit you with my d*ck, and your
whole family gets f*cked."

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.540
BRUH!

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.800
Turn off the spotlight!

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.120
What else did happen
in the past few months?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.780
Oh, yes. How can I forget? Probably
the biggest trend of this year-

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.560
BINOD

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.740
What happened, Aditya?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.920
Guys, I invited just Gautami,
but Abhyudaya came as well.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.360
Hello, hello!
Slayy Point, everybody! Woo!

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.160
Gautami: Abey!

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.120
Ah, finally. Slayy Point on
my channel, everybody. Woo!

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.060
Safety precautions...On Saiman Shows,
all safety precautions are taken.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.820
Gautami, put your
index finger [here], yes.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.400
It should be about 97-98° on the oximeter.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.360
It's 99° here, so this is totally safe.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.360
Please put your, uh...
why doesn't it fit?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.160
Where did your buy this?
This doesn't fit.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.500
Just for safety, you can wash
your hands there, please.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.040
We have all the necessities
in our studio.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.300
Gautami: We sanitised. This too?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.200
Saiman: No, no, no.
Gautami: We sanitised. This too?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.420
Abhyudaya: It'd be more
effective with dish soap.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.500
Saiman: Okay.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.300
Saiman: Thank you! Thank you very much.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.060
Abhyudaya: I should scrub as well.
Saiman: Thank you! Thank you very much.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.420
Saiman: Uh, no, no! Not there!

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.660
Abhyudaya, I've got a special
seat for you there. Right there.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.140
Saiman: Please.
Abhyudaya: Seriously?

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.900
Saiman: Yes.
Abhyudaya: Seriously?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.420
Here, only verified accounts get chairs.
I'm sorry.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.065
(Ba Dum Tss)

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:04.400
Take your mask off, man.
Show your pimples to the camera.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.420
Nice, very nice. Wow.
Okay...

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.300
So finally, Slayy Point on my channel.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.800
Do you remember what happened
the last time you were on my channel?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.740
- No.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.820
Okay, guys. I'm here with my favourite
Indian YouTubers, everybody.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.160
Saiman: Say hi to...
Gautami: Excuse me?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.400
Saiman: Hi!
Gautami: Who are you?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.960
Saiman: I am Saiman.
Abhyudaya: Okay?

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.640
Saiman: You don't know me?
Abhyudaya: No.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.140
Saiman: Guys, please...
Gautami: We gotta go.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.700
Abhyudaya: Are you
a waiter here?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.820
Okay, so Slayy Point.
Almost at 3 million subscribers, huh?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.040
How does it feel to be the second best
reaction channel on Indian YouTube?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.860
- Who's the first? You?

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.220
- I mean, of course.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.300
- Having your audience make some memes,
which they've already seen,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.320
reacting to it with two lines and calling
it content, at least we don't do that.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.560
- At least I don't make Q&amp;A videos.
Okay...

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.520
How do you feel?
Reacting on other people's content,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.200
and gaining views from it,
how do you feel?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.300
- It takes weeks of research.
We've a lot of videos to research.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.040
It has a sketch segment as well.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.540
We don't sit on the same chair
with a green screen.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.280
- No, no, no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.820
This is not a joke, okay?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.440
You guys are destroying
the career of other YouTubers.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320
Watch this.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.860
Cool Tech: In India, you'll find
a solution for everything.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.200
So guys, I've got the
YouTube algorithm, I've hacked it.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.920
Now in my YouTube channel...

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.860
Slayy Point has roasted me.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.280
At 19 seconds in, in their latest video,
which has 1 million views.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.940
Any big YouTuber makes a video
on you at any time,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.620
and your career is over, guys.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.320
Career's over. Over.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.300
They destroy the career
of small YouTubers.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.940
Doing so much hard work,
and watching someone roast you,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.540
your career's over.
I mean, it's done.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.760
I mean, your career's over
in an instant.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.420
- So, Slayy Point,
any reactions?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.020
You're climbing to success by stepping on
small YouTubers. You know that?

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.120
- But here we are, to make
a small YouTuber's career.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.960
- Didn't you do much research? The guy's
been uploading regularly since a year.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.040
His career's okay.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640
In fact, it's his most viewed video.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.580
- No, no, no, no, no.
In fact, it's his most viewed video.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.900
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.940
He'd been uploading
regularly since a year,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.820
but his channel didn't grow.
Right, Gautami? Huh?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.840
No. And you tweeted this.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.840
You've tweeted, and I quote,
"based on the current scenario,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.800
a lot of upcoming YouTubers are going to
take 6-7 years to hit a million subscribers."

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.640
No, I mean. It's okay. You wrote this
according to your experience.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.860
Talented people won't need this
much time, but okay. It's fine.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.000
- Then why you're taking so much time?
-Yeah, how long have you been on YouTube?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.260
- The Xavier's vlog, what year was that?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.520
- All your old vlogs,
how many years has it been?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.520
- It's okay, though. 3 years ago,
I made vlogs about Xavier.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.960
You made cricket videos.
Silly, Silly Point.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.220
Your channel name was
'Silly Point' back then.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.960
At least you were self aware back then.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.020
(Ba Dum Tss)
At least you were self aware back then.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.660
Silly...

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.820
You have a gaming channel- SlayyPop.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.980
Right? SlayyPop.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.760
Huh! It's alright. I mean,
even big people make mistakes, right?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.100
But my question is- why didn't
you name it 'Playy Point'?

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.300
- I wish we could react the same
watching your videos.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.580
But, okay. We add our creativity.
- Okay.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.760
- Saiman Says to Saiman "Sees",
Saiman Says to Saiman "Plays",

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.720
we can't do basic things like that.
- And what's this Saiman "Shows"?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.260
You haven't showed us anything.
We've been sitting here.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.360
- Yeah, what shows?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.320
- There's my cameraman, Kartik.
He's shooting your reactions.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.540
Can you kick him on the Main Point?

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.100
It'd be fun seeing Slayy Point
kicking the Main Point.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.860
(Ba Dum Tss)

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.780
- I can't find a 2-rupee change.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.960
- Maybe you guys don't know, but Slayy
Point made a roast video on CarryMinati.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.160
It was 3 years ago, but then
they deleted the video.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.400
I don't know why?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.600
I mean not everybody has balls
as big as Saiman Says, right?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.620
Sometimes I get back pain "carrying" them.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.620
- Next question.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.500
- Slayy Point, I expect some
enthusiasm from you guys. Okay?

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.700
This isn't some YouTube
Fan Fest's red carpet event.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.180
Don't poop here. Okay? Please.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.340
- What is up, everybody?
- Are you guys ready for YT Fan Fest 2019?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.020
- Woah!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.700
- Anyway, I'll send you an unlisted
video link for this. Okay?

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.800
You can tell me which parts
I do need to edit out.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.860
Please don't make me
delete the video, okay?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.420
Recently, through your video,
a viral trend emerged, okay?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.600
What was it? Binod!
Yeah, Binod.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.140
- Do you guys believe in
stereotypes or myths?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.180
I mean, for example, a myth
I don't believe in is MythPat,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.580
because he's a normie, okay?
But a myth I do believe in

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.020
is that a guy and a girl
can't be friends. Okay?

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.540
So...
where are you guys going?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.560
At least plug your merch.
You came to plug your merch.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.860
I mean, CarryMinati and Greta Thunberg
should complete their education first,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.760
then they should talk
about educating others, right?

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.040
- One minute, one minute.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.800
This time, CarryMinati is right.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.320
Don't roast him
every time without logic.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.920
Do you even remember what
happened last time?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.980
- Did I ask you?

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.620
Huh?

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.140
Did I ask you?

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.940
Motherf**ker!

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.900
Gautami: ...takes research.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.760
It has a sketch segment as well.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.740
We don't sit on the same chair
with a green screen.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.780
Abhyudaya: Why are you asking us this?
You already know how it feels...

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.420
to react on other's content.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.420
Saiman: But the video should
be entertaining, right? Okay.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.420
BRUH!

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.700
Saiman: Go backstage!
